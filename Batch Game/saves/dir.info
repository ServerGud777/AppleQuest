This is only used for the save data of the Char's
in .dll form with no set command in frount of any of the varibals. 
It will be done when the file is is loaded as the char data.

Ex. charHP=152

Non Ex. set charHP=152

There is no need for the set because the command running this file is:
for %%A in (filename) Do set %%A

if there was two sets it would set "set" as the variba; and charHP=152 as the data for the set var.
